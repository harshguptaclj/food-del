## Description

A complete food ordering website using React JS, MongoDB, Express, Node JS and Stripe payment gateway. In this Full Stack Food delivery website project I created the Frontend website, Admin Panel and Backend server. 
I also created the user authentication system so that anyone can create an account and login this food order website.
Further I created the shopping cart functionality so that user can add food items in their cart and order food from this app. I also integrated the Stripe payment gateway to place the order and with online payment. Then I created the order status update features also.
